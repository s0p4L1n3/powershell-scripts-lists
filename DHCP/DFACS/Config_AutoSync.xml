        Default Replication Mode: 
            By default, the tool auto synchronizes the changes across all 
     Failover (relations on this server 

        Selective Replication Mode: 
            If you choose to include only specific Failover relation(s) that 
     should be synchronized by this tool, do the following

            a) Uncomment <FailoverRelationships> node given below
            b) Add the Failover relationship names under <Include> node, 
 the ones you wish the tool should auto synchronize.
               [This means, all the other relationships will be ignored by the tool]
            c) Add the Failover relationship names under <Exclude> node, 
               the ones you wish the tool should Exclude from auto synchronization.
               [This means, all the other relationships will be 
                considered by the tool for auto synchronization]
